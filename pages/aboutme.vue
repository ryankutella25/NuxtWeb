                    I am currently working towards my Computer Science Degree at The University of Alabama. 
                    I am passionate about software development and like turning creative ideas into a reality. 
                    I am an incoming senior and have been coding programs for over 7 years, starting freshman year of 
                    high school. I have been adding different skills and programming languages into my arsenal as I go. 
                    I've played a large role in the web development of a multi-million dollar company and have multiple other projects displaying my skills.
